## Network emulator - MPLS
This application has been created as a part of TSST course.

This project aimed at showing how Multiprotocol Label Switching technology works. 
We put much emphasis on the vital aspect of MPLS i.e. label: swapping, pushing and popping. 
Application is written in C# language with the use of asynchronous and synchronous sockets from *System.Net.Sockets* library.
