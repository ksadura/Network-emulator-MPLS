# Network emulator - MPLS
This application has been created as a part of "Transport and Control in Telecommunication Networks" course.
## Brief description
This project aimed at showing how Multiprotocol Label Switching technology works. 
We put much emphasis on the vital aspect of MPLS i.e. label: swapping, pushing and popping. 
Application consists of (checked modules created by myself):
- [x] Cable cloud for packet forwarding
- [x] Management system for management and configuration with GUI
- [ ] Nodes (routers)
- [ ] Hosts.

Each instance of above modules (also depicted on Fig. 1) opens a seperate TCP socket for receiving and forwarding incoming MPLS packets. Application is written in .NET environment using C# language.
